#PURPOSE: Program to manage memory usage - allocates
# and deallocates memory as requested
#
#NOTES: The programs using these routines will ask
# for a certain size of memory. We actually
# use more than that size, but we put it
# at the beginning, before the pointer
# we hand back. We add a size field and
# an AVAILABLE/UNAVAILABLE marker. So, the
# memory looks like this
#
# #########################################################
# #Available Marker#Size of memory#Actual memory locations#
# #########################################################
#                                 ^--Returned pointer
#                                                points here
# The pointer we return only points to the actual
# locations requested to make it easier for the
# calling program. It also allows us to change our
# structure without the calling program having to
# change at all.

##########FUNCTIONS############

##allocate_init##
#PURPOSE: call this function to initialize the
#         functions (specifically, this sets heap_begin and
#         current_break). This has no parameters and no
#         return value.

    movl %esp, %ebp

    #If the brk system call is called with 0 in %ebx, it
    #returns the last valid usable address
    movl $SYS_BRK, %eax     #find out where the break is
    movl $0, %ebx
    int $LINUX_SYSCALL

    incl %eax               #%eax now has the last valid
                            #address, and we want the
                            #memory location after that

    movl %eax, current_break #store the current break

    movl %eax, heap_begin   #store the current break as our
                            #first address. This will cause
                            #the allocate function to get
                            #more memory from Linux the
                            #first time it is run

#END OF FUNCTION allocate_init

##allocate##
#PURPOSE: This function is used to grab a section of
#         memory. It checks to see if there are any
#         free blocks, and, if not, it asks Linux
#         for a new one.
#
#PARAMETERS: This function has one parameter - the size
#            of the memory block we want to allocate
#
#RETURN VALUE:
#           This function returns the address of the
#           allocated memory in %eax. If there is no
#           memory available, it will return 0 in %eax
#
#Variables used:
#              %ecx - hold the size of the requested memory
#                     (first/only parameter)
#              %eax - current memory region being examined
#              %ebx - current break position
#              %edx - size of current memory region
#
#We scan through each memory region starting with
#heap_begin. We look at the size of each one, and if
#it has been allocated. If it's big enough for the
#requested size, and its available, it grabs that one.
#If it does not find a region large enough, it asks
#Linux for more memory. In that case, it moves
#current_break up
